<h2>Usage</h2>

<p> First, I use Live Server to run the program either on http://localhost:5500 or npm run dev. 
Another possibility to view it is through github pages, you can access through this link: 
  <a href="https://jparmo.github.io/apiRickyMorti/">https://jparmo.github.io/apiRickyMorti/</a>.</p>

<p> The app shows the different characters of Rick and Morti, the functionality is you can show each of the 
  characters by clicking on the upper right tab, to see the previous characters you can press the upper left 
  button and if you want to return to the top of the page you have the bottom right button. This project took me approximately 
  3 hours to do taking into account the time of designing the page with css. </p>
